# Solutions for advent of code 2019

Here you can (eventually) find all solutions and tests that I used for solving each day of advent of code 2019.

Info on advent of code [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about).

Event [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

Advent of code is the perfect way to learn a new programming langage. Since I already have a basic knowledge of Python, it was an easy choice for me. 

My goal here is first to solve each day of the event on my spare time. I'll try to complete it before the 2020 edition. Since I have the opportunity of taking my time, my priority is to write code that follow good practices and learn as much as possible about python along the way.

Each folder contain code and input for testing and solving each day. The first dependency needed is of course [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), other dependencies will be specified in the folder README.

Enjoy!
