# Day 11

[Instructions](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/11)

Once again I have to use my Intcode program. Its purpose here is to use it as the brain of a painting robot that can only go up, down, right and left. For part 1 I had to count how many tiles the robot paint at least once. In part 2 I use [Tkinker](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) to output the finale message. I used positions as in a graph, but multiplied every outputs to be easily readable.
